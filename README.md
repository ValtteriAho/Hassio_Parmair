## Quick Start

### Installation (3 Steps)

**1. Add to HACS**
- Open HACS → Click ⋮ (top right) → Custom repositories
- Add: `https://github.com/ValtteriAho/Hassio_Parmair`
- Category: Integration → Add
- Find "Parmair MAC" → Download
- Restart Home Assistant

**2. Find Your Device IP**
- Check your router's connected devices list
- Look for "Parmair" or "MAC" device
- Note the IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

**3. Add Integration**
- Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration
- Search "Parmair MAC"
- Enter your device's IP address
- Click Submit → Done!

> 💡 **That's it!** The integration automatically detects your device model, software version, and available features.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Connect?

**Check your IP address**
- Make sure the IP is correct (check your router)
- Device must be on the same network as Home Assistant

**Still not working?**
- Port: Should be `502` (usually auto-configured)
- **Slave ID: Must be `0` (not 1!)** ← Most common issue!
  - If you installed before February 2026, your Slave ID might be wrong
  - Delete the integration and re-add it

### Sensors Not Updating?

**Restart Home Assistant** after installing the integration.

**Some sensors missing?**
- Humidity and CO2 sensors only appear if your device has that hardware
- Check your Parmair device specifications

**Sensors showing 0 or -1?**
- This is normal! The device reports these values during calibration
- Sensors update every 30 seconds
- -1 means "calibrating" for CO2 sensors
- 0% humidity is a valid reading

### Need More Help?

[Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ValtteriAho/Hassio_Parmair/issues) with:
- Your device model (MAC80/100/150)
- Software version (visible in Home Assistant after setup)
- What's not working

## What You Get

Once installed, you'll have control over:

### Main Controls
- **Fan Entity** - Power on/off and mode switching (Away/Home/Boost)
- **Speed Presets** - Set fan speeds for each mode (Home, Away, Boost)
- **Temperature Targets** - Adjust supply and exhaust temperature setpoints
- **Timers** - Control how long Boost and Overpressure modes run

### Monitoring
- **Temperatures** - Fresh air, supply, exhaust, and waste air
- **Humidity** - Current level and 24-hour average (if equipped)
- **CO2 Levels** - Exhaust air quality monitoring (if equipped)
- **Operating Status** - Current mode, speed, and power state
- **Alarms** - Active warnings and filter status

### Smart Features
- **Summer Mode** - Automatically adjusts ventilation based on outdoor temperature
- **Time Programs** - Enable/disable scheduled operation
- **Heater Control** - Manage heating elements (see warning below)
- **Filter Tracking** - Monitor when filters need replacement

> **⚠️ Heater Control Warning:**
> 
> Disabling the heating elements entirely carries inherent risks and may void warranty coverage. While heating elements are the primary energy-consuming components in the ventilation system, they are essential for freeze protection and optimal operation.
> 
> When using external automation systems (such as Home Assistant) to override the device's built-in control logic, the manufacturer cannot accept liability for component failures or malfunctions that occur during the warranty period. Any damage resulting from modified heater control settings may not be covered under warranty.

## Example Automations

### Boost When Cooking
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Boost ventilation when cooking"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.kitchen_motion
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: fan.set_preset_mode
        target:
          entity_id: fan.parmair_mac
        data:
          preset_mode: "Boost"
```

### Away Mode When Nobody Home
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Reduce ventilation when away"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: group.all_persons
        to: "not_home"
        for: "00:30:00"
    action:
      - service: fan.set_preset_mode
        target:
          entity_id: fan.parmair_mac
        data:
          preset_mode: "Away"
```

### Filter Change Reminder
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Remind to change filter"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.parmair_mac_filter_status
        to: "Replace"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Ventilation Filter"

### Communication
- Protocol: Modbus TCP
- Default Port: 502
- Slave ID: 0 (changed from 1 in v0.9.0.5)
- Polling: Every 30 seconds (configurable 10-120s)

### Requirements
- Home Assistant 2023.1 or newer
- Network connectivity to Parmair device
- Modbus TCP must be enabled on device

### Performance
The integration reads registers sequentially with 200ms delays to prevent overwhelming the device. Updates occur every 30 seconds by default. More frequent polling may cause communication errors.

### Version Detection
The integration automatically reads:
- Hardware model (MAC80/100/150)
- Software version (1.x or 2.x)
- Heater type (Water/Electric/None)
- Available sensors (humidity, CO2)

If auto-detection fails, you can manually select these during setup.
